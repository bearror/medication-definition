## TODO

Explore which resources should be generated from the raw data. There's a couple
of potentially interesting `CodeSystem` resources, and the various files could
be condensed into actual `MedicinalProductDefinition` resources. It's probably
not worth it to split everything into products, packages and items â€” given that
I'm far more interested in the intersection of the medication definition and
clinical reasoning modules.
