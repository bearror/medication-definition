## TODO

1. Explore which resources should be generated from the raw data. There's a
   couple of potentially interesting `CodeSystem` resources, and the various
   files could be condensed into actual `MedicinalProductDefinition` resources.
   It's probably not worth it to split everything into products, packages and
   items â€” given that I'm far more interested in the intersection of the
   medication definition and clinical reasoning modules.
2. Create a basic CDS Hooks service using the open data for supply shortages
   and/or interchangeable medicinal products. This marks a good spot to explore
   abstractions for getting the auth right. Optimally, go for solutions that
   result in verifiable formal constraints. That is, include acceptance tests
   for ensuring that the conformance language defined in the CDS Hooks spec is
   actually followed. (Constraints should be explicit!)
3. Investigate the Meds75+ database and how it might be transformed into
   `MedicationKnowledge` and/or `ClinicalUseDefinition` resources. This marks
   the obvious point-of-interest for clinical reasoning and clinical decision
   support. Create additional CDS Hooks services where it makes sense.
4. Wire up the CDS Hooks feedback endpoint, and figure out all the housekeeping
   (e.g. observability) for running these on a serverless platform. _(Remember
   to include the necessary regulatory disclaimers...)_
5. Oh yeah, and since Deno Deploy supports WASM, this'll be a good chance to
   finally bite the bullet and get started with Rust. This might have to wait
   until I get to clinical reasoning, though, since FHIRPath and ELM execution
   are actually valuable targets. Same goes for supporting SDC operations.
